base85-ipv6
===========

Implementation of encoding in base85 as detailed in RFC 1924 ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1924 )

This is a pure JS implementation which differentiates it from the `base85` module that uses a native bignum module. The goal of this module is compatibility across platforms not performance.

This module's focus is on the ipv6 implementation as described in the RFC.
